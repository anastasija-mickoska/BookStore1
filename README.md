This project is a web application developed in .NET Core (C#) as part of a practice project for managing an online book store. The app allows users to browse all books, search books by genre or author, view details about a chosen book, and buy books. After completing a purchase, users can leave reviews on the books they have bought. The project follows the MVC architecture, with Entity Framework Core for database management, ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization, and Razor views for the frontend.
